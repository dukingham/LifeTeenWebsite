                        Hi! My name is Grace and I'm a 5 year Lifeteen CORE Veteran. 
                        I was raised in a loving, Catholic household where I was taught the importance of love, prayer and service. 
                        My relationship with God became stronger through my high school years as an active youth group member and my 
                        faith deepened during my time at Monmouth University as a member of the Catholic Campus Ministry. 
                        I currently work as a high school science teacher and enjoy working with and mentoring young people. 
                        In my spare time I enjoy hiking, camping, and adventuring in our nation's beautiful National Parks. 
                        I find that I feel closest to Jesus when I'm out and enjoying nature!
